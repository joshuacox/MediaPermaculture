# [Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) 

Is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) as "the development of agricultural ecosystems intended to be sustainable and self-sufficient."

In our sense though we are looking to make media creation that is sustainable and self-sufficient in that we can teach others to freely use the same software.  Normal paid-for media creation software can be prohibitively expensive.  In this those of means can purchase and join the game, but this prevents one of the most important artists of yore, the starving artist.  

Using free and open source software removes these barriers.  I have a $140 dollar laptop that has outperformed other laptops that cost ten times more.  The fact is that even a "smart" phone has more computing power than full machines did not too long ago.  You'd think we would just be amazed at how fast our machines are these days.  However, the commercial OS offerings have gotten so complex that most people getting a new machine are struck with the feeling that they got a slower machine than their older one.  This is because hardware manufacturers are failing to keep up with [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), but the increasing complexity of the software has not slowed down. 

Time to find an alternative.  It's like peeling all of the crap out of a car that is not absolutely essential and building a racer.  The car then accelerates off the line faster, it's top speed is greater, braking is better, and cornering speeds are greatly improved.  In short, if you get rid of all the unnecessary crap every performance metric improves.

Ok, at this point I have to post this [link](https://fun.irq.dk/funroll-loops.org).  The Gentoo Ricer is an example that this can be taken too far.  So for now, I will leave Gentoo for the initiated.  Instead, I'll be focusing on Debian and Ubuntu.  Possibly a chapter each on Arch, Fedora, Gentoo or even a BSD, or even ubuntuBSD in the future, but we'll see.
