# Audio Editing

### [KXstudio](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/)

KXStudio is a collection of applications and plugins for professional audio production.
KXStudio provides Debian and Ubuntu compatible repositories and its own Linux Distribution currently based on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS.

### [Qtractor](http://qtractor.sourceforge.net/)

Qtractor is an Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application written in C++ with the Qt framework. Target platform is Linux, where the Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) for audio, and the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI, are the main infrastructures to evolve as a fairly-featured Linux desktop audio workstation GUI, specially dedicated to the personal home-studio.

Of note, this is the same [guy](http://www.rncbc.org/) who originally wrote [Qjackctl](http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/)

### [Qjackctl](http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/)

QjackCtl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon, specific for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

### [Qsynth](http://qsynth.sourceforge.net/qsynth-index.html)

Qsynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the Qt framework using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth management application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of command line softsynth but for the moment it wraps the excellent FluidSynth. FluidSynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the Soundfont specification.

### [Rakarrack](http://rakarrack.sourceforge.net/)

Rakarrack is a richly featured multi-effects processor emulating a guitar effects pedalboard.  Effects include compressor, expander, noise gate, graphic equalizer, parametric equalizer, exciter, shuffle, convolotron, valve, flanger, dual flange, chorus, musicaldelay, arpie, echo with reverse playback, musical delay, reverb, digital phaser, analogic phaser, synthfilter, varyband, ring, wah-wah, alien-wah, mutromojo, harmonizer, looper and four flexible distortion modules including sub-octave modulation and dirty octave up.  Most of the effects engine is built from modules found in the excellent software synthesizer ZynAddSubFX.  Presets and user interface are optimized for guitar, but Rakarrack processes signals in stereo while it does not apply internal band-limiting filtering, and thus is well suited to all musical instruments and vocals.  Rakarrack is designed for Linux distributions with Jack Audio Connection Kit.

### [Guitarix](http://guitarix.org/)

guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running on Jack Audio Connection Kit. It is free as in speech and free as in beer. The available sourcecode allows to build it on other UNIX-like systems, too, namely for BSD and for MacOSX.

guitarix takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would do: as a mono-signal from your sound card. The input is processed by a main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and deliver a processed stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the rack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules including stuff from a simple noise gate to brain-slashing modulation f/x like flanger, phaser or auto-wah.

Your signal is processed with minimum latency. On any properly set-up Linux-system you don't have to wait more than 10ms until your sound is processed by guitarix.

### [ZynAddSubFX](http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/)

ZynAddSubFX is a fully featured open source software synthesizer capable of making a countless number of instruments, from some common heard from expensive hardware to interesting sounds that you'll boost to an amazing universe of sounds. This cross-platform project is under active development and for information on the next major update (3.0.0) please sign up for more information

#### [Yoshimi](http://yoshimi.sourceforge.net/)  (fork of ZynAddSubFX)

Yoshimi is a software synthesizer for Linux, a "fork" of ZynAddSubFX. ZynAddSubFX was founded by Nasca Octavian Paul and continued by many others; several years later, Yoshimi was founded by our dear friend, the late Cal, at a time when ZynAddSubFX showed amazing promise but did not satisfy his needs and ours. If you enjoy profound and powerful tonality with your Linux, please do try Yoshimi, we think you will feel the love!
