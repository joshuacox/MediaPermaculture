# Office

Everyone needs a basic text editor, spreadsheet, etc. So let's start with some M$ Slothice alternatives.  And then I'll point out some more specialized alternatives.

Ok, the big two are

### [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/)

and

### [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/)

Now, LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice that happened around the time Sun Microsystems was bought by Oracle.  The entire story can be read [here](https://opensource.com/life/15/8/libreoffice-community-achievements).  Know that, today, you can choose either one and never know the difference.  But if I was to lean one way or the other, I'd push you toward LibreOffice just because of the GPL.

### [Koffice](https://www.kde.org/applications/office/)

KDE offers a suite of programs to assist in an office type environment, although it seems most of this has evolved into...

### [Calligra](https://www.calligra.org/)

Which appears to be an evolution beyond Koffice, looks very interesting indeed.

# Text editors

## CLI editors

### [VIM](http://www.vim.org/)

While the learning curve is steep, this is one worthy endeavor.  Learning VIM is a lifetime skill.  Unlike some software that comes and goes VIM has roots that go back 50 years!  This is my editor of choice and while daunting to beginners it is possibly the most powerful piece of software I've ever come across, and learning it is deeply rewarding in that it makes you many times more powerful.

### [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

I would be remiss to not mention Emacs, the debate between VIM and EMACS is more of a religious one that anything  based on fact that often ends in all out [WAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war).  I'll let you decide.

## GUI

### [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/)

> The Kate project develops two main products: KatePart, the advanced editor component which is used in numerous KDE applications requiring a text editing component, and Kate, a MDI text editor application. In addition, we provide KWrite, a simple SDI editor shell which allows the user to select his/her favourite editor component.

### [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit)
> 
While aiming at simplicity and ease of use, gedit is a powerful general purpose text editor. 

### [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Is the new kid on the block 

> Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.


## Spreadsheet

### [GNUmeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/)

> Welcome to the home of The Gnumeric Spreadsheet. Gnumeric is an open-source spreadsheet program. Gnumeric is...
