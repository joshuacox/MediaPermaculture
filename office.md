# Office

Ok, the big two are

### [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/)

and

### [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/)

Now, LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice that happened around the time Sun Microsystems was bought by Oracle.  The entire story can be read [here](https://opensource.com/life/15/8/libreoffice-community-achievements).  Know that, today, you can choose either one and never know the difference.  But if I was to lean one way or the other, I'd push you toward LibreOffice just because of the GPL.
