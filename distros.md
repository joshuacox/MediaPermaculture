# Distros

## General Linux Distros

These are battle hardened distros that lock down their available software to frozen releases which only get security updates.  This means they should be very stable, which is great for new users who don't want to have to be fixing their OS while trying to get work done.

### [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)

If this is your first time in Linux, then Linux Mint is probably the easiest distro to install with the least amount of hiccups.  It is actually a derivative of...

### [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

Which is the distro from Mark Shuttlesworth who made a ton of money in the SSL racket before starting Ubuntu which is actually a derivative of....

### [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

> The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is called Debian.

### [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)

> Fedora Workstation is a polished, easy to use operating system for laptop and desktop computers, with a complete set of tools for developers and makers of all kinds.

## Media Creation Specific Distros

These distributions are all specifically designed to create media.  Start with a general linux distro above before delving into these.  After you've seen the default linux experience it is a great idea to dual boot with an extra partition using one of these, so you can see the differences side by side on a single computer.

### [Slacker Media](http://slackermedia.info/)

> Slackermedia is documentation providing the information a user needs to create a full multimedia studio running on Slackware Linux. It teaches users how to build a home studio using only the best in multimedia content creation tools that Linux has to offer.

> ackermedia is not a "laundry list" of multimedia apps that are half-finished, nor a blueprint for mindlessly installing apps you'll never use, nor a series of mindless install scripts. It is a series of tutorials on understanding the UNIX way as it applies to the artistic process, designing a personalised workflow, and configuring a system so that it works for you and not against you.

### [KXstduio](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/index.php)

> Studio is a collection of applications and plugins for professional audio production.
KXStudio provides Debian and Ubuntu compatible repositories and its own Linux Distribution currently based on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS. 

### [UbuntuStudio](http://ubuntustudio.org/)

> Ubuntu Studio is a free and open source operative system, and an official flavor of Ubuntu. Ubuntu Studio is the most widely used multimedia orientated GNU/Linux distribution in the world. It comes preinstalled with a selection of the most common free multimedia applications available, and is configured for best performance for the Ubuntu Studio defined workflows: Audio, Graphics, Video, Photography and Publishing.

### [CCRMA](http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/)

Pronounced like 'karma'

> Planet CCRMA at Home is a collection of free, open source software packages that you can add to a computer running Fedora 22, 23 or 24 or CentOS 5 to transform it into an audio/video oriented workstation. Here at CCRMA we use a consistent and well defined Linux environment for our daily work in audio and computer music and research. With the Planet CCRMA at Home package collection, you can easily install most of that environment on your own Linux system. 

## Advanced Distros

These distributions should not be your first linux experience, but definitely recommended after you've tried all the General Linux distros above as these will teach you about low level linux techniques the above hide from you.  You will have to roll up your sleeves and put on your adult pants in these distributions.  Things will break from time to time while updating your machine, and it will be up to YOU to fix it!  Or give up in shame and reinstall from scratch, tarring up your home folder and etc before you blow away the hard disk.

### [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/)

Be sure and see [slackermedia](http://slackermedia.info/) if you are going this route.  Klaatu has made this a very stable distro, which puts slackware on the fence of the advanced to medium user level, as I think you will see far less breakage in slack than the next two I will mention.

> The Official Release of Slackware Linux by Patrick Volkerding is an advanced Linux operating system, designed with the twin goals of ease of use and stability as top priorities. Including the latest popular software while retaining a sense of tradition, providing simplicity and ease of use alongside flexibility and power, Slackware brings the best of all worlds to the table. 

### [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)

> a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.

The big advantage/disadvantage of Arch Linux is cutting edge vs. bleeding edge.  It is both it's greatest advantage, in that you get the newest versions of software just days after they are released upstream.  This is also the greatest peril of Arch, in that shit will break on you all the time when people decide to change something that is not backwards compatible, or some other unforeseen difficulty.  However, that being said, I love ARCH!  It's my personal favorite.

### [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/)

> Welcome to Gentoo, a flexible, source-based Linux distribution that becomes just about any system you need—and much more.

## DIY Distro

*Warning: this is way beyond gentoo levels of pain, only for the truly masochistic* 

It would be deficient to not mention the ultimate DIY distro:

### [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

> Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.
