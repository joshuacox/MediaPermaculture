# File Management

One of the most important things you have to stay on top of is a decent file management system.  As an artist you will be developing a portfolio of work that you will extend upon every time you start a new project.  There are times when creatively you will want to start fresh and not start with old templates.  But even then you will quickly start slipping in techniques you have learned through previous projects.  As a graphic artist you will want a large library of both raster and vector graphics.  As a musician, you'll want to gather interesting synthesizers and most likely 'presets' for those synthesizers.  3D artists will want models, textures, scenes, and audio to go with it.  And filmmakers will require all of the above and screenwritings, kitchen sinks, and loads of stuff I'm leaving out.
