# Screenwriting

First I want to point you to [fountain](http://fountain.io/), in it's own words 

> "Fountain is a plain text markup language for screenwriting."



What this means is that fountain is merely a plain text file and ANY text editor can work the files.  There are also some applications that are built for it specifically and include various buttons that help you insert the usual screenwriting elements.

They have a good introduction [here](http://fountain.io/howto)

You can try it out here at [dingus](http://fountain.io/dingus)

Or take a look at the apps [page](http://fountain.io/apps)

Where you'll find emacs, VIM, and all sorts of mac, windows, and Linux specific applications, of which my favorite at the moment is [Trelby](http://www.trelby.org/) for Linux, and [dubscript](https://www.dubscript.com/) on android, and of course I still use VIM as well.
